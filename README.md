# Simple WebRTC implementation

WebRTC is a technology that enables real-time communication directly
between browsers, allowing audio, video, and data sharing.
This example implements a simple chat application using it.

## Demo

The demo lies in `Cloudflare pages` which is a great alternative to serve static generated sites.

## Next steps

We can automate even more the signaling process by builing a signling server. It can be also done using `Cloudflare workers` solution.
